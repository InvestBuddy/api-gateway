## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. **Access Endpoints**: Once the API Gateway is running, use a client like Postman to test the routes:

    Example for retrieving users from the User Service:

    ```bash
   GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users

2. **Authentication**:

    Add a JWT token in the Authorization header for secured endpoints:

    ```bash
    Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
